# Mohawk College - SQL Assignment: Hospital Database Queries

## Project Overview

This project involved analyzing the **Hospital** database using **Microsoft Access** and writing SQL queries to extract key information about doctors, patients, nurses, wards, and specialties.

The database tracks:
- Doctors and their specialties
- Nurses and ward assignments
- Patients and their assigned doctors and wards

The goal was to write and save SQL queries that answer specific questions about the hospital's operations.

## Summary of SQL Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Retrieval & Filtering:** Used `SELECT` with `WHERE` clauses to extract specific records, such as patients without doctors or by health card number.  
- **Joins:** Applied `LEFT JOIN` and `INNER JOIN` to combine data across related tables (doctors, patients, nurses, wards, specialties).  
- **Aggregation & Grouping:** Used `COUNT()` and `GROUP BY` to summarize data, like patient counts per doctor or ward, and doctor counts by specialty.  
- **Sorting:** Implemented `ORDER BY` to organize results, e.g., ordering doctors by patient count.  
- **Distinct Records:** Used `DISTINCT` to eliminate duplicates in doctor-specialty listings.  
- **Top Records:** Used `TOP 1` to find the doctor with the highest patient count.

This project demonstrates foundational SQL techniques for querying, analyzing, and reporting healthcare data.
